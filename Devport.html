              The combined experience I have working at the top Fortune 500
              companies has allowed me to developer a skillset that helps me in
              not just development, but in every aspect of any business.
            </p>
            <p>
              I'm proud to announce that I am now working at one of the world's
              largest communities teaching young minds about how to sell
              yourself as a developer and open them to a whole new world of
              opportunities.

              As a developer, you have everything available to you and all
              that's holding you back is yourself.

            <p>A quote I live by perfectly illustrates what I mean.</p>
            <p>
              "How big would you dream, if you knew you wouldn't fail?" You've
              already gone through the hardest parts being a developer, it's
              time to elevate your skills and become a leader in something
              you're passionate about.
            </p>

              I'm happy to chat over coffee some time about how I can help your
              company.
